## Overview

## Intro

Simple responsive page with a blog preview card, part of the [Learning Paths](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths) from FrontEnd Mentor.
This is my second project which I used to practice Angular on my journey of learning this language, this is my first time
creating multiple components and interfaces and trying to divide a project into smaller pieces to work with angular

## My process

As this has been my first time actually working on my own to divide a project into smaller components with angular I decided
to start from the bottom and start doing the author card as a component, as they are 2 different components inside, then
the rest of the content as a single component and later I wrapped it into another blog-card-component which while not necessary
for this particular small project I felt would be a good idea in-case I had to keep working on it and add functions or events.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/) - JS library
